no lipo batt connected to sim808 chip!!

bigger eeprom? slide-out eeprom? + slide-out serial connector to d/l data

learn APNs

add shocky to step-down? 12m@ https://training.ti.com/comparing-synchronous-and-non-synchronous-dcdc-converters (but mainly for heavy loads so no-op?) but shotty makes it much cooler

jumper/switch for timer pin A to reduce time

expose all eeprom pins through header so can connect from externally? Or could have a switch to dump all via serial/ethernet
+ easy put on LED maintenance set/or have secret button for it somewhere with lid?

NB: 1h39 time between cycles, 3m3 between small cycles

circuit capacitors voltage check

resistors check

power unit increase voltage/ensure output is 5V, not less

farnell power adaptor increase in power

1 cap per IC

replace generic connectors in digram with actuals

change timing interval connectors

add test line/board/header

wire sizes check
 
use ferrite beads etc. after fully reading https://simcom.ee/documents/SIM800A/SIM800A_Hardware%20Design_V1.02.pdf

check what happens if all sms full
