circuit capacitors voltage check
resistors check
power unit increase voltage/ensure output is 5V, not less
easy put on LED maintenance set/or have secret button for it somewhere with lid?
farnell power adaptor increase in power
1 cap per IC

replace generic connectors in digram with actuals
change timing interval connectors

add test line/board/header
wire sizes check

timing every 4 hours - collect and save every 24hrs. bigger eeprom? slide out eeprom?

no lipo batt connected to sim808 chip!!

expose all eeprom pins through header so can connect from externally
