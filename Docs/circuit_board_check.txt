NB: 1h39 time between cycles, 3m3 between small cycles

check what happens if all sms full

https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/439/why-does-starting-the-serial-monitor-restart-the-sketch

circuit capacitors voltage check

resistors check

power unit increase voltage/ensure output is 5V, not less

easy put on LED maintenance set/or have secret button for it somewhere with lid?

farnell power adaptor increase in power

1 cap per IC

replace generic connectors in digram with actuals

change timing interval connectors

add test line/board/header

wire sizes check

bigger eeprom? slide out eeprom?

use ferrite beads etc. after fully reading https://simcom.ee/documents/SIM800A/SIM800A_Hardware%20Design_V1.02.pdf

no lipo batt connected to sim808 chip!!

expose all eeprom pins through header so can connect from externally? Or could have a switch to dump all via serial/ethernet

jumper/switch for timer pin A to reduce time
