*** measurements ***
with usb attached + battery & with transmit -> current battery ~ 300ma, never higher than 400ma
with no usb attached + battery -> current battery fluctuates a lot but 13-47ma is consumed WHEN ARDUINO IS OFF.
* (with linear regulator?) *
arduino power consumption with shield power on -> constantly 500mA.
arduino power consumption with shield power off -> 90-140mA as shield LEDs light on&off.
* with ldo *
arduino power consumption with shield power off -> ~50mA, roughly constant
arduino power consumption with shield power on -> start quick peak @ 600mA, 70-140mA (even while transmitting)
* with ldo, but shutdown pin=1 *
arduino power consumption with shield power connected (jst-pin) -> ~54mA constant
arduino power consumption with shield power disconnected (jst-pin) -> ~53mA constant
arduino power consumption with ldo disconnected -> ~52mA constant



Pre-switching-regulator power usage of timer (no LEDs)
@12v - 0.9mA (1.0 with LED) 
@6V - 1.5mA

LP3966: R2=22.8kOhms, 100uF Tantalum has gone on C_IN (still not good enough), 100pF on output (not 68pF)


@LDO Output: 
	330uF Alum cap + 3*100uF caps = 3/3 successess
	330uF Alum cap + 2*100uF caps = 3/3 successess
	330uF Alum cap + 1*100uF caps = 3/3 successess
	330uF Alum cap + 0*100uF caps = 3/3 successess
*WAIT FOR 20 MINS*
	1000uF Alum cap = 1/1 success
	330uF Alum cap + 0*100uF caps = 0/2 successess
	330uF Alum cap + 3*100uF caps = 0/3 successess
	
	

	//Next tasks
	//		xx Switch off the external power to FONA on start-up until fona needed (so get base voltage steady for good sensor reading)
	//		xx Update Schematic with above switch 
	//	Add sensor-logic with pins, shunt, current check etc. + update schematic
	//	Test transmission with 12 readings worth of data and 1kuF cap still ok?
	//	Add EEPROM rolling logic test + any other software updates
	//	Add LEDs/output-print etc. logic for jumpers, directing SIM808's LED to surface of box
	//	Run whole board (with timer circuit) test with linear 30V->5V regulator
	//	Add any components from above testing to existing purchase-list
	//	Lots of reading on safety around circuit, fuses etc. and add anything extra to purchase-list
	//	Make purchase from purchase-list
	//	[When Components Come] Full test with Tant. Caps instead of Alum. Cap. @LDO-Output + @LDO-Circuit
	//	[When Components Come] EEPROM: Run tests for the bigger memory size
	//	
	
	//Design/PCB
	//	Make sure connections wide enough

cap failure should never short circuit; need fuse incase short-circuit
derate the voltage rating by a factor of 3-4 if you want the full capacitance.
***** check ESR on my 100uF caps !! *****
we need - switching optimal main regulator **optimised for timer's current** but up to 2A max
	- tantalum caps (or other robust ones at 1k Farads?) and several varieties to be deployed in parallel
	- update tantalum cap on LDO
	- several reverse voltage protection
	- another cheap step-down (several quantity)
	- ldo suitable tantalum caps
	- rigid breadboard circuit cables (?)
	- fuses
Increase the 33PF and 10PF capacitors can effectively eliminate the high frequency interference. A 5.1V/500mW
Zener diode is strongly recommended, the diode can prevent chip from damaging by the voltage surge. These
capacitors and Zener diode should be placed as close as possible to SIM808 VBAT pins.




The ERROR pin must be connected to ground if this function is not used
If the sense option pin is not required, the sense pin must be connected to the VOUT pin.
reverse current flow protection from LDO

In designs, caps need to be near devices - <1cm

ESD protection for LDO - https://www.design-reuse.com/articles/42191/low-dropout-ldo-linear-voltage-regulators.html

no lipo batt connected to sim808 chip!!

bigger eeprom? slide-out eeprom? + slide-out serial connector to d/l data

learn APNs

add shocky to step-down? 12m@ https://training.ti.com/comparing-synchronous-and-non-synchronous-dcdc-converters (but mainly for heavy loads so no-op?) but shotty makes it much cooler

jumper/switch for timer pin A to reduce time

expose all eeprom pins through header so can connect from externally? Or could have a switch to dump all via serial/ethernet
+ easy put on LED maintenance set/or have secret button for it somewhere with lid?

NB: 1h39 time between cycles, 3m3 between small cycles

circuit capacitors voltage check

resistors check

power unit increase voltage/ensure output is 5V, not less

farnell power adaptor increase in power

1 cap per IC

replace generic connectors in digram with actuals

change timing interval connectors

add test line/board/header

wire sizes check
 
use ferrite beads etc. after fully reading https://simcom.ee/documents/SIM800A/SIM800A_Hardware%20Design_V1.02.pdf

check what happens if all sms full
